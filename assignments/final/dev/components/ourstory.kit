<p class="paragraph1"> 25 years ago, in the blistering summer heat of Barcelona, 
everything changed. The haters said it could never happen, 
but we made history. In that summer of 1992, 11 hall of 
famers came together to form the greatest team, ever assembled, 
in the history of team sports…wait…scratch that…that’s the 
history of the Dream Team, what were we thinking?</p>

<div class="ourstory__body2"> 
<p> Back in 2012 some friends with a shared love of 
cycling and too much time on their hands started a 
fake race team. From an old VW van in Topanga, California 
we built a team with a strict focus on looking good and
 having fun. A small batch of kits for friends eventually 
 turned into some sweatshirts and hats, which, 
 largely because of a few die-hard, loyal customers, 
 has blossomed into the Team Dream you’re seeing now. </p>

<div class="ourstory__body3"> 
<p> After our first few humble batches, we decided that we 
wanted to do more than just put our graphics on jerseys and 
tees. We wanted to make the clothing we would want to wear 
ourselves, and find a way to make it in Los Angeles. We 
started working on sourcing our own materials & designing 
our own fits in 2013. Since then, we’ve been hands-on with 
all of our apparel manufacturers to develop products that 
are 100% approved by Team Dream. That means we spend a whole 
lot of time on every t-shirt, sweatshirt, jersey and bib we 
sell. Being involved with every step of production means we 
bring you the best possible finished product.

<div class="ourstory__body4"> 
<p> All of our apparel is responsibly made in the USA and 
most is produced within 30 miles of our headquarters in 
San Marino, Calif.
</p>

<div class="ourstory__body5"> 
<p> Proximity allows us to build relationships that benefit 
our final product, and working hands-on with our manufacturers 
also ensures that our designs are the right balance of great 
quality and minimal freeway time (the traffic in Los Angeles 
can be horrific!).

<div class="ourstory__body6"> 
<p> Fast forward to today, Team Dream is working with a very 
small number of special retail partners globally, though 
most of our sales still come through our web store. From the
 beginning, the brand was built around selling direct to the 
 consumer to keep the pricing obtainable (and let's be honest, 
 most bicycle shops have already blacklisted Sean for bringing 
 in feral cats during his visits). Since the majority of our 
 stuff is sold direct to you, we are able to use the best 
 possible materials & domestic production while saving you 
 money on high quality apparel.
