<p> In 2015 we stumbled upon a tiny, dilapidated old 
PacBell phone company building and saw our future. 
We got in touch with the owners, found out it was 
scheduled for demolition and thought "purrfect!"

<p> After some negotiating (and a lot of begging) we worked 
enough magic to get keys to the place. The Cub House in South 
Pasadena opened in late 2015. In addition to being the 
temporary office for both Team Dream and Ringtail, The Cub House 
grew into a local spot for cyclists to hang out and buy cycling 
product they had only seen prior on the internet. We began to
 carry much more than just Team Dream and watched the space evolve 
 into a cycling apparel store stocking more than 15 other small 
 brands. Stray cats, much like vampires, have to be invited into 
 your home in order to wreak havoc, but just like those pasty blood 
 suckers, once the Team Dream boys are in the door there is no 
 getting rid of us! That being said, what was originally scheduled 
 to be a 6 month pop-up shop lasted much longer. Until one day the 
 lights went out and the wrecking ball showed up.

<p> We were back out on the street, but it didn't take long 
for us to spot our next home. A mile down the road we found 
a service station turned greenhouse and began a whole new 
set of negotiations to move in our growing empire. In 2017 
the current location of The Cub House opened at 2510 Mission 
Street in San Marino, California.

<p>Our new location provided us the space to expand things 
a bit. In addition to being the headqurters for Team Dream 
and Ringtail, The Cub House is also home to a full service 
bike shop, Prickley Pals and Pump Coffee. Our store carries 
products from a few dozen small retailers and our pop-up space 
hosts a rotating assortment of interesting things.
