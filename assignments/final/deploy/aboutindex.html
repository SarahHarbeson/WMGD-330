    <div class="ourstory__body"> 
    <p> 25 years ago, in the blistering summer heat of Barcelona, 
    everything changed. The haters said it could never happen, 
    but we made history. In that summer of 1992, 11 hall of 
    famers came together to form the greatest team, ever assembled, 
    in the history of team sports…wait…scratch that…that’s the 
    history of the Dream Team, what were we thinking?</p> 
    </div> 
    
    <img class="_hero" src="./img/teamdream.jpg" alt="Team Dream" />
    
    <p> Back in 2012 some friends with a shared love of 
    cycling and too much time on their hands started a 
    fake race team. From an old VW van in Topanga, California 
    we built a team with a strict focus on looking good and
     having fun. A small batch of kits for friends eventually 
     turned into some sweatshirts and hats, which, 
     largely because of a few die-hard, loyal customers, 
     has blossomed into the Team Dream you’re seeing now. </p> 
     
     <img class="_hero" src="./img/bikestand.jpg" alt="Team Dream" />
     <img class="_hero" src="./img/shopinside.jpg" alt="Team Dream" />
    
    <p> After our first few humble batches, we decided that we 
    wanted to do more than just put our graphics on jerseys and 
    tees. We wanted to make the clothing we would want to wear 
    ourselves, and find a way to make it in Los Angeles. We 
    started working on sourcing our own materials & designing 
    our own fits in 2013. Since then, we’ve been hands-on with 
    all of our apparel manufacturers to develop products that 
    are 100% approved by Team Dream. That means we spend a whole 
    lot of time on every t-shirt, sweatshirt, jersey and bib we 
    sell. Being involved with every step of production means we 
    bring you the best possible finished product.
    </p> 
    
    
    <p> All of our apparel is responsibly made in the USA and 
    most is produced within 30 miles of our headquarters in 
    San Marino, Calif.
    </p> 
    
    <p> Proximity allows us to build relationships that benefit 
    our final product, and working hands-on with our manufacturers 
    also ensures that our designs are the right balance of great 
    quality and minimal freeway time (the traffic in Los Angeles 
    can be horrific!).
    </p>

    <p> Fast forward to today, Team Dream is working with a very 
    small number of special retail partners globally, though 
    most of our sales still come through our web store. From the
     beginning, the brand was built around selling direct to the 
     consumer to keep the pricing obtainable (and let's be honest, 
     most bicycle shops have already blacklisted Sean for bringing 
     in feral cats during his visits). Since the majority of our 
     stuff is sold direct to you, we are able to use the best 
     possible materials & domestic production while saving you 
     money on high quality apparel.
